# Procedural-Animation
CDC Project. The goal is to create a spider and use procedural animation for its legs when walking. <br> <br>

# Roadmap <br>
1. Use inverse kinematics to control the leg
2. Fix the bottom of the leg to the ground
3. Make a target point attached to the body
4. Raycast from the target point downwards to move it up & down
5. Check the distance from the foot to the target point
6. Move leg when the distance gets too big
7. (Walking pattern) Put the legs in a zigzag pattern
8. Only move the leg when opposite legs are grounded
9. Use the average leg position + offset for the body position
10. Rotate the body based on the difference between the left and the right leg height.
